# Electric-Blinds-v2

Hardware and software for the first version were made quickly because the focus was on 3d printing gears. When the gears and transmission proved to be very good, I decided to make a better software for ESP that will add more controls and features. [Here is demo video of v1](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6BQB3ug1dN/).


An improvement is the ESP32, which has a dual-core, which will enable control of the stepper motor in real time.
